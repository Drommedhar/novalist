# Copilot Instructions

Before responding that work is finished, you MUST run `npm run verify` and confirm it completed successfully.
Warnings are strictly disallowed; resolve all warnings before considering work finished.
Do NOT use `eslint-disable` comments to suppress lint errors; fix the underlying issue instead.
